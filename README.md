# Bookmobile

This single-page app is an example of the fast and dynamic features of React.js.  Provided
with a static page structure, my task was to create a fully-functional single-page app utilizing
React components, state management, and object-oriented programming.

## Purpose & Use
The Bookmobile is designed to keep track of your personal reading lists in three categories:
1. Currently Reading
2. Want to Read
3. Already Read


You may also search the catalog to add books to any of your categories.

### Install & Run
You may clone or download a copy of this page at https://github.com/SallyMstar/bookMobile.git .

Once your local copy has been created, run [npm install] in a terminal window from the newly-created directory.
After installation is complete, start a local server by typing [npm start] from the same terminal window directory.  A new browser window will automatically open the app for your use.  Subsequent use of the app will only require typing [npm start] from the bookmobile directory in a terminal window.
