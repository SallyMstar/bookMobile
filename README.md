# Bookmobile

This single-page app is an example of the fast and dynamic features of React.js.  Provided
with a static page structure, my task was to create a fully-functional single-page app utilizing
React components, state management, and object-oriented programming.

## Purpose & Use
The Bookmobile is designed to keep track of your personal reading lists in three categories:
    1. Currently Reading
    2. Want to Read
    3. Already Read


You may also search the catalog to add books to any of your categories.
